### MongoDB
In all my previous projects with a database I used a relational SQL-DB. So this is the very first time for me to try out a no SQL, file based database. Simply explained, in a noSQL Database the data isn't stored in columns and rows but in files.  

#### MongoDB vs SQL

Documents are organized in Collections. In a SQL-DB, a collection would be a table and a row a document.
Data is organized in field-value pairs, like _key & value_ in JSON or a JS object.  
A document is stored in `BSON` format, which means _Binary_ JSON. BSON for example allows additional data types like `Integer`, `Long`, `Float`, `Date`.

>__Clusters:__ Group of servers that store your data.  
__Replica Set:__ A few connected machines that store the same data to ensure that if something happens to one of the machines the data will remain intact.




#### Tutorials
Those links helped me out to understand MongoDB:
- [M001: MongoDB Basics](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M001/about)
- [M100: MongoDB for SQL Pros](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M100/about)

- [M103]

## Prototype
For concept and design purposes I created a simple prototype using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).  
Launch the prototype with this link: https://www.figma.com/file/5cJqJfXD5euCykWQKnMR2E/Home?node-id=0%3A1
